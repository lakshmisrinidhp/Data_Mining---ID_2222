Sentiment analysis of tweets is a powerful application of min- ing social media sites that can be used for a variety of social sensing tasks. Common feature engineering techniques fre- quently result in a large numbers of features being generated to represent tweets. Many of these features may degrade clas- sifier performance and increasing computational cost. Fea- ture selection techniques can be used to select an optimal sub- set of features, reducing the computational cost of training a classifier, and potentially improving classification perfor- mance. Despite its benefits, feature selection has received lit- tle attention within the tweet sentiment domain. We study the impact of ten filter-based feature selection techniques on clas- sification performance, using ten feature subset sizes and four different learners. Our experimental results demonstrate that feature selection can significantly improve classification per- formance in comparison to not using feature selection. Ad- ditionally, both choice of ranker and feature subset size sig- nificantly impact classifier performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which extensively studies feature selections effect on tweet sentiment classification.
