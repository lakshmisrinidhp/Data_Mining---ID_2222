Many Liberal Quakers have taken Buddhism into their spiritual lives, drawing primarily upon its meditation methods and its philosophy. How does this fit with Quakerism’s Christian foundations? Buddhist meditation methods are used to help Quakers touch a spiritual depth, but between Buddhist and Quaker religious experience a question arises: are meditative/mystical states natural, or do they require an Other, God, as agent? This issue is related to contemporary Liberal Quaker ambiguous feelings about “God” language and frequent preference for words like “Light” and “Spirit.” Buddha Nature and Inner Light both represent the immanence of the transcendent, but how similar are these concepts? Nondualistic Buddhist philosophy is a resource for those Quakers who find that “God” language does not adequately capture their spiritual experience.
