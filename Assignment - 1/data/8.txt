A direct knowledge of Buddhism was obtained with the translations of D.T. Suzuki, the inter-religious conferences the activity of the Pali Text Society. Buddhist missions were established for Asiatic immigrants in the US. But a central contribution was provided by few courageous pioneers that after WW2 obtained a direct training by masters into Buddhist monasteries in Asia, later bringing their own teachings back to their countries of origin. The practice of Buddhism was thus established in the West, based on its basic moral and communitary principles and values. It is noteworthy that the practice of meditation, which was limited to the ordained monks residing into Asiatic monasteries, has become a central part of the practice by Western Buddhists, and in the developments of mindfulness.
