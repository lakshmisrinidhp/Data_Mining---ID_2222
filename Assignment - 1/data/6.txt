Item-item collaborative filtering (CF) models are a well known andstudied family of recommender systems, however current literaturedoes not provide any theoretical explanation of the conditions underwhich item-based recommendations will succeed or fail.We investigate the existence of an ideal item-based CF methodable to make perfect recommendations. This CF model is formalizedas an eigenvalue problem, where estimated ratings are equivalent tothe true (unknown) ratings multiplied by a user-specific eigenvalueof the similarity matrix. Preliminary experiments show that themagnitude of the eigenvalue is proportional to the accuracy ofrecommendations for that user and therefore it can provide reliablemeasure of confidence
