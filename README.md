## **1. Data Mining Assignments**
### 1.1 Text Similarity using Jaccard and LSH
- Implemented a pipeline to find textually similar documents using:
  - **Jaccard Similarity** for set comparison.
  - **MinHashing** to generate efficient signatures.
  - **Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)** to identify similar pairs efficiently.
- Applied to datasets of web pages and emails.

### 1.2 Frequent Itemsets and Association Rules
- Developed the **A-Priori algorithm** to identify frequent itemsets in transaction datasets.
- Generated association rules with customizable support and confidence thresholds for market basket analysis.

### 1.3 Streaming Graph Processing Algorithms
- Built real-time graph processing algorithms using:
  - **Reservoir Sampling** for managing stream data.
- Applied for **triangle counting** and transitivity in dynamic graph datasets.

### 1.4 Spectral Clustering
- Implemented the **K-Eigenvector algorithm** for graph clustering.
- Analyzed real-world and synthetic graphs to identify communities and segment structures.

### 1.5 Distributed Graph Partitioning
- Developed and optimized the **Ja-Be-Ja algorithm** for partitioning large graphs.
- Improved performance using **simulated annealing** and analyzed its effects on edge cuts and convergence time.
